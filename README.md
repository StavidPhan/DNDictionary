# DNDictionary

DNDictionary is an English dictionary application developed by a team of three members: Phan Thanh Duy, Mai Anh Đức, and Nguyễn Văn Nam. This project was created as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at the University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

## Features

2. **Add, Edit, and Delete Words**: Users can add new words to the database, as well as edit or delete words they have added.
3. **Vocabulary Games**: The application includes three vocabulary games: Hangman, Multiple Choice, and Choose Item, which help users practice and review their vocabulary.
4. **Translation**: Users can use the built-in translation feature to translate text between English and other languages, powered by an API.
